pykde4 (4:4.6.80-0r1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO: Update debian/copyright.
        Less python related warnings (dpkg-gencontrol).
        Fix W: python-kde4-dbg: python-debug-in-wrong-location.

  * Initial standalone release: split off from kdebindings.
  * Below you will find notable changes from previous kdebindings packaging.

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * Require KDE SC 4.6.3
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2: no changes needed.
  * Switch debian/rules engine to dhmk based debian-qt-kde.mk.
  * Pick pykde4 related patches from the kdebindings package and include them
    in this package.
  * Strip sequence numbers from the patch filenames.
  * Clean up Uploaders list.
  * Clean up Build-Depends list.
  * Add libboost-dev to Build-Depends.
  * Fix binNMUability of python-kde4-dev: depend on python-kde4 (>=
    ${source:Version}) rather than ${binary:Version}. python-kde4-dev is
    arch:all.
  * Switch to dh_python2 (thanks to Scott Kitterman):
    - drop python-support from Build-Depends;
    - use python2 dh addon in place of python-support;
    - drop XB-Python-Version control field and remove debian/pyversions;
    - add "X-Python-Version: >= 2.5" to the source section.
  * Drop pydefault make variable, not used anymore.
