cmake/

java/
      LGPLv2+. Currently not built.
csharp/
	Most files autogenerated by kalyptus. They are shipped autogenerated because the autogenerator is still a bit flaky and needs manual hand holding.
	The non-autogenerated files is gplv2+

falcon/krossfalcon/cmake
	BSD as in CMAKE-COPYING-SCRIPTS. fullquoted later
falcon/
	LGPLv2+

kalyptus/
	Several files states GPL - and the generic README states GPL
php/
      GPLv2+ + exceptions. Might be have issues if built (gpl, php, ..), haven't studied it closely, but currently it is not built 
               and building php-qt will require a separate package
python/
      krosspython: bsd-ish, LGPLv2+
      pykde4: LGPLv2.1+
ruby/
      GPLv2
  qtruby/src/
      LGPLv2+
smoke/
	smoke.h is BSD licensed.
	The rest of smoke is quite trivial and autogenerates code with kalyptus
xparts/
      GPLv2 with some parts under LGPLv2 - effectively GPL. Currently not built.
